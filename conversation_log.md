- Request: "please rework the plan on ocr method since we're using purely ai vision for extracting data from receipt image. please refer @mataresit"
- Action: Updated `enhanced_flutter_android_development_plan.md` to remove all on-device OCR references, align with pure AI Vision (Gemini) pipeline, and adjust dependencies, offline behavior, testing, performance targets, and risk mitigation accordingly.
- Response Summary: Confirmed update and noted sections revised: Core Features, Key Dependencies, Camera Integration, AI Processing Integration, Offline Capabilities, Performance Optimization, Testing Strategy, Performance Targets, and Risk Mitigation.

## 2025-08-27 17:27 +08:00

- Request: "please help setup the project to reduce the git changes done using git ignore"
- Action: Refined root `.gitignore` to ignore Flutter metadata and plugin files (`.metadata`, `.flutter-plugins`), temp/backup patterns (`pubspec_temp.yaml`, `*.backup`, `*.orig`, `*.rej`), environment files (`.env*`), and web subproject build/deps/caches (`mataresit/dist/`, `mataresit/node_modules/`, `mataresit/.vite*/`, `mataresit/.cache/`).
- Response Summary: This should reduce noise from build outputs, cache directories, and ephemeral files across Flutter and the `mataresit/` web subproject. Next step: verify with `git status`.

- Request: "how can we build the android apk from the flutter app to test?"
- Action: Provided step-by-step guidance and commands to build Debug and Release APKs with Flutter, including `--split-per-abi`, signing notes for release builds, flavor usage, and APK output paths. Offered to run the build commands upon approval.
- Response Summary: Use `flutter build apk --debug` for a quick test APK, or `flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi` for production-like artifacts. Outputs are under `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`. For release signing, configure `android/app/key.properties` and signing configs in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`.

- Request: "how to resolve flutter doctor issue in vscode below logs where the the xcode installation is incomplete. i've install xcode beta in this macos but flutter doctor cant seem to detect it. attached screenshot show the xcode version installed."
- Action: Investigated Xcode detection by logging diagnostics (`xcode-select -p`, `xcodebuild -version`) and provided a step-by-step fix: switch to the correct Xcode path (including beta), accept license, run first-launch setup, ensure Command Line Tools are set in Xcode Preferences, clear any conflicting `DEVELOPER_DIR`, update Flutter, and re-run `flutter doctor`.
- Response Summary: Likely causes are (a) `xcode-select` pointing to Command Line Tools or the non-beta app, (b) first-launch not completed, or (c) Flutter not updated for the beta SDK. Resolution steps and verification commands provided.

- Request: "Add these folders to git ignore for remote only but not local dev: .augment, .archive, .dart_tool, .idea, .qoder, docs; and advise on any others safe to ignore without affecting CI/CD or functionality."
- Action: Reviewed `.gitignore` and CI references. Confirmed `.dart_tool/` and `.idea/` already covered. No CI jobs depend on `docs/` (workflows already have `paths-ignore: docs/**`). Updated `.gitignore` to add `.augment/`, `.archive/`, `.qoder/`, and `docs/`, plus extra safe ignores for IDE caches and platform user data (e.g., `.fleet/`, `.gradle/`, Xcode `xcuserdata/`).
- Notes: To remove already-tracked items from remote while keeping local copies, use `git rm -r --cached <path>` and commit.
- Response Summary: Implemented requested ignores without impacting CI/CD or app behavior.

- Request: "Proceed to remove those folders from remote too using the untracking command."
- Action: Ran `git rm -r --cached .augment .qoder docs` and committed. Initial push rejected (remote ahead). Performed `git stash` (including ignored with `-a`), `git pull --rebase origin master`, then `git push`. Restored local working changes via targeted stash apply. Result: remote no longer tracks `.augment/`, `.qoder/`, `docs/`.
- Response Summary: Untracking commit pushed successfully. Local untracked copies remain for development.

## 2025-09-11 03:24 +08:00

- Request: "help create a comprehensive prompt on this project for designing agent to create the best ui/ux for mobile app."
- Action: Drafted a reusable, fill-in-the-blank prompt template for a UI/UX design agent covering role, objectives, audience, platforms, branding, accessibility, IA, key flows, patterns, design system tokens, deliverables, workflow, checklists, and output format.
- Response Summary: Provided a comprehensive prompt template and guidance to tailor it to the project, ensuring consistent, accessible, and high-quality mobile app UI/UX outcomes.

## 2025-09-13 16:08 +08:00

- Request: "how do we resolve this issue for these logs in this flutter project: [CocoaPods did not set the base configuration ... include the Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig in your build configuration (Flutter/Release.xcconfig)]."
- Action: Verified `ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig` and `ios/Flutter/Release.xcconfig` already include the corresponding Pods configs via `#include?`. Created missing `ios/Flutter/Profile.xcconfig` with `#include? "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig"` and `#include "Generated.xcconfig"`. Provided steps to ensure Xcode target `Runner` base configurations point to the Flutter xcconfigs (Debug/Release/Profile) and to re-run `pod install` / clean build if needed.
- Response Summary: The warning appears because Profile config was missing and/or Xcode base configs werenâ€™t set. Adding `Profile.xcconfig` and ensuring the Runner target uses Flutter xcconfigs resolves CocoaPods integration.
