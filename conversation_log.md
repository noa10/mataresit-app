- Request: "please rework the plan on ocr method since we're using purely ai vision for extracting data from receipt image. please refer @mataresit"
- Action: Updated `enhanced_flutter_android_development_plan.md` to remove all on-device OCR references, align with pure AI Vision (Gemini) pipeline, and adjust dependencies, offline behavior, testing, performance targets, and risk mitigation accordingly.
- Response Summary: Confirmed update and noted sections revised: Core Features, Key Dependencies, Camera Integration, AI Processing Integration, Offline Capabilities, Performance Optimization, Testing Strategy, Performance Targets, and Risk Mitigation.

- Request: "please help setup the project to reduce the git changes done using git ignore"
- Action: Refined root `.gitignore` to ignore Flutter metadata and plugin files (`.metadata`, `.flutter-plugins`), temp/backup patterns (`pubspec_temp.yaml`, `*.backup`, `*.orig`, `*.rej`), environment files (`.env*`), and web subproject build/deps/caches (`mataresit/dist/`, `mataresit/node_modules/`, `mataresit/.vite*/`, `mataresit/.cache/`).
- Response Summary: This should reduce noise from build outputs, cache directories, and ephemeral files across Flutter and the `mataresit/` web subproject. Next step: verify with `git status`.

- Request: "how can we build the android apk from the flutter app to test?"
- Action: Provided step-by-step guidance and commands to build Debug and Release APKs with Flutter, including `--split-per-abi`, signing notes for release builds, flavor usage, and APK output paths. Offered to run the build commands upon approval.
- Response Summary: Use `flutter build apk --debug` for a quick test APK, or `flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi` for production-like artifacts. Outputs are under `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/`. For release signing, configure `android/app/key.properties` and signing configs in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`.

- Request: "how to resolve flutter doctor issue in vscode below logs where the the xcode installation is incomplete. i've install xcode beta in this macos but flutter doctor cant seem to detect it. attached screenshot show the xcode version installed."
- Action: Investigated Xcode detection by logging diagnostics (`xcode-select -p`, `xcodebuild -version`) and provided a step-by-step fix: switch to the correct Xcode path (including beta), accept license, run first-launch setup, ensure Command Line Tools are set in Xcode Preferences, clear any conflicting `DEVELOPER_DIR`, update Flutter, and re-run `flutter doctor`.
- Response Summary: Likely causes are (a) `xcode-select` pointing to Command Line Tools or the non-beta app, (b) first-launch not completed, or (c) Flutter not updated for the beta SDK. Resolution steps and verification commands provided.
