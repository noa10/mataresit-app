# Database Directory

This directory contains database-related files for the Mataresit project.

## Contents

- `schema.sql` - Complete database schema dump from Supabase
- Future: Additional database documentation, scripts, or schema files

## Purpose

This directory organizes all database-related files separately from the main project root to improve project organization and maintainability.

## Note

The main database migrations are still located in `supabase/migrations/` as per Supabase conventions. This directory is for additional database-related files like schema dumps and documentation.
