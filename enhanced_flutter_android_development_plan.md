# Enhanced Flutter Android App Development Plan

## 1. Codebase Analysis ✅

Based on comprehensive analysis of the existing web application in the `mataresit/` directory, I've identified a sophisticated receipt management system called **Mataresit** with the following enhanced characteristics:

### Core Features Identified:
- **AI-Powered Processing**: Automatic data extraction using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite

- **Analytics & Reporting**: Data visualization and insights with Recharts integration
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe-based subscription management with multiple tiers
- **Multi-language Support**: i18next internationalization (English and Malay)
- **Real-time Features**: Live updates and notifications using Supabase real-time
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrative controls and user management
- **Advanced Search**: Semantic search with embedding functionality
- **Claims Management**: Expense claim processing and approval workflows
- **Background Processing**: Queue-based processing for heavy operations

- **Caching**: Advanced caching with React Query and custom cache management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics, custom performance monitoring, alerting systems

### Database Schema:
The Supabase database includes extensive tables with Row Level Security:
- User management and authentication

## 2. Flutter Architecture Planning

### State Management: Riverpod
**Rationale**: Based on the web app's context-based architecture, Riverpod provides:
- Provider-based state management mirroring React contexts
- Type safety and compile-time error detection
- Excellent testing capabilities with dependency injection
- State persistence and hydration
- Performance optimization with auto-disposal
- Real-time synchronization capabilities

## 3. Database Integration Strategy

### Supabase Integration:
- **Same Backend**: Leverage existing Supabase project for data consistency
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Implement live updates for collaborative features
- **RLS Policies**: Utilize existing security policies with Flutter auth
- **Edge Functions**: Call the same serverless functions for AI processing
- **File Storage**: Use Supabase Storage with optimized upload/download
- **Migration Support**: Handle schema changes with proper versioning

### Data Models:
Create comprehensive Dart models mirroring web app interfaces:
- User/Profile with preferences and settings
- Receipt with processing status and AI metadata
- LineItem with categorization and tax information
- Team, TeamMember with roles and permissions
- Analytics data with chart-compatible structures
- Subscription and payment tracking
- Notification and alert management
- Claim with approval workflow
- Search embedding and semantic data

### Offline Capabilities (Enhanced):
- **Local Database**: Hive for structured data storage
- **Sync Mechanism**: Queue-based sync with conflict resolution; AI extraction is deferred until online
- **Offline Receipt Capture**: Store images locally with minimal metadata (timestamp, team, notes) until connectivity
- **Background Sync**: WorkManager for automatic background synchronization
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on failure
- **Incremental Sync**: Smart syncing based on last modified timestamps
 - **Upload Policy**: Adaptive image compression (target < 1.5MB, max dimension 2000px) prior to upload to control bandwidth and costs

## 4. Mobile-Specific Enhancements

### Camera Integration:
- **Advanced Camera**: Custom camera with receipt detection overlay
- **Auto-capture**: Intelligent capture on receipt detection
- **Multi-format Support**: JPG, PNG, PDF receipt processing
- **Batch Capture**: Multiple receipt scanning in sequence
- **Image Enhancement**: Auto-straighten, denoise, and compress to optimize AI Vision extraction

### AI Processing Integration:
- **Google Gemini Integration**: Direct API calls for receipt parsing using the same prompt/templates as the web app (`mataresit/`), invoked via Supabase Edge Functions where applicable
- **Pure AI Vision Pipeline**: No on-device OCR. All extraction occurs via Gemini after upload
- **Network Loss Behavior**: Degraded "capture-and-queue" mode — store image + metadata locally and enqueue upload; process via Gemini once connectivity returns
- **Processing Queue**: Background job queue with exponential backoff, jitter, and idempotency keys to avoid duplicate extractions
- **Smart Categorization**: AI-powered categorization using model output with deterministic post-processing rules mirroring web
- **Language Handling**: Delegate detection to Gemini; ensure prompts support EN/MS and receipts with mixed languages

### Notification System:
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
- **Local Notifications**: Scheduled reminders and alerts
- **Rich Notifications**: Images and action buttons
- **Notification Channels**: Categorized notifications (receipts, teams, payments)
