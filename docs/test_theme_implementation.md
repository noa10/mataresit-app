# Theme Implementation Test Guide

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Theme Models (`lib/shared/models/theme_model.dart`)
- **ThemeMode enum**: Light, Dark, Auto (system preference)
- **ThemeVariant enum**: Default, Ocean, Forest, Sunset
- **ThemeConfig class**: Configuration model with mode and variant
- **ThemeVariantDefinition**: Color definitions for each theme variant

### 2. Theme Service (`lib/core/services/theme_service.dart`)
- Supabase integration for theme persistence
- Save/load theme preferences from database
- User-specific theme storage

### 3. Theme Provider (`lib/shared/providers/theme_provider.dart`)
- Riverpod StateNotifier for theme state management
- Local storage persistence with SharedPreferences
- Database sync for authenticated users
- System theme detection for auto mode
- Helper providers for MaterialApp integration

### 4. Theme Settings Screen (`lib/features/settings/screens/theme_settings_screen.dart`)
- Theme mode selection (Light/Dark/Auto)
- Theme variant selection with color previews
- Current theme status display
- Loading states and error handling
- Localized UI

### 5. Main App Integration (`lib/app/app.dart`)
- Dynamic theme generation based on selected variant
- Real-time theme switching without app restart
- Material 3 design system integration

### 6. Navigation Integration
- Added theme settings route to router
- Updated settings screen with theme navigation
- Current theme display in settings list

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Basic Theme Switching
1. Open the app
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Tap on "Theme" (should show current theme mode and variant)
4. Try switching between Light, Dark, and Auto modes
5. Verify the app theme changes immediately

### 2. Theme Variants
1. In theme settings, scroll to theme variants section
2. Try different variants: Default, Ocean, Forest, Sunset
3. Verify color changes are applied immediately
4. Check color previews match the actual theme

### 3. Auto Mode
1. Set theme to "Auto"
2. Change system theme (iOS: Settings > Display & Brightness)
3. Verify app follows system theme

### 4. Persistence
1. Change theme settings
2. Close and reopen the app
3. Verify theme settings are preserved

### 5. User Authentication
1. Sign in with a user account
2. Change theme settings
3. Sign out and sign in again
4. Verify theme settings are synced from database

## Expected Behavior

### Theme Modes
- **Light**: Always light theme regardless of system setting
- **Dark**: Always dark theme regardless of system setting  
- **Auto**: Follows system preference (light/dark)

### Theme Variants
- **Default**: Blue primary color (Material 3 default)
- **Ocean**: Deep blue/teal color scheme
- **Forest**: Green/earth tone color scheme
- **Sunset**: Orange/warm color scheme

### UI Features
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Immediate visual feedback
- Loading indicators during theme changes
- Error handling with user feedback
- Localized text (English/Malay)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Theme not changing**: Check if theme provider is properly initialized
2. **Settings not persisting**: Verify SharedPreferences permissions
3. **Database sync failing**: Check Supabase connection and table existence
4. **Auto mode not working**: Verify system theme detection

### Debug Steps
1. Check Flutter logs for theme-related errors
2. Verify theme_preferences table exists in Supabase
3. Test with different user accounts
4. Try clearing app data and testing fresh install

## Feature Parity with React Web Version

✅ **Implemented Features:**
- Theme mode switching (Light/Dark/Auto)
- Theme variant selection (Default/Ocean/Forest/Sunset)
- Local storage persistence
- Database synchronization
- System theme detection
- Real-time theme switching
- Settings screen integration
- Color previews
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Localization support

✅ **Design Consistency:**
- Similar UI layout to React version
- Matching color schemes for variants
- Consistent user experience
- Material Design adaptation of web design

The Flutter implementation now has complete feature parity with the React web version while following Flutter/Material Design best practices.
